# Docker Compose with random ports

## Why?

Ever thought that maybe running several projects with docker is nice to have.

Ya well...but docker itself can't bind random port or iterate over ports until the next one is free

### Solution

In this repo you will find a script that determine the next port starting at `:80`.

### Usage

Clone this project and `cd` into it.

After just type `./start-local-server` and hit enter.
